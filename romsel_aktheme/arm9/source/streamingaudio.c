/*
 * The maxmod stream request handler. 
 * 
 * This method is called automatically by maxmod at random times.
 * 
 * While streaming from RAM is a trivial matter, streaming from
 * a file is a bit more involved because SD access is much slower.
 * 
 * We can't fread in the stream request handler, or it will take
 * too long and the DS will crash. We can load it after as soon as
 * possible, but there is no guarantee that it will be finished 
 * before we need to stream again. Waiting until we've run out
 * of things to stream and then loading new samples is too slow.
 * We need it to be "just-in-time".
 * 
 * The buffers that play_stream_buf and fill_stream_buf must be
 * completely filled with audio data before the first call to
 * this method. This is set up by sound.cpp.
 * 
 * Samples are then streamed from play_stream_buf. Once a 
 * sample has been compied to dest (and thus streamed), it
 * is replaced by a sample from the same location at 
 * fill_stream_buf. Hence there is always new data at
 * play_stream_buf.
 * 
 * Every SAMPLES_PER_FILL, a fill request is made. This is
 * handled by sound.cpp, and copies enough data to replace
 * the number of samples that were streamed since the last
 * fill request into the fill_stream_buf. This ensures that 
 * there is always new data in the fill_stream_buf, and that
 * data is only overwritten once it has been copied into
 * play_stream_buf.
 * 
 * streaming_buf_ptr keeps track of where in the buffers
 * data will be read from. This is reset after STREAMING_BUF_LENGTH
 * samples have been streamed.
 * 
 * In combination, this creates two looping buffers that ensure
 * that new data is ready just in time.
